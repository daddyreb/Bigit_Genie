L_NETWORKPROBLEM_FAQ_LABEL="How can a new computer or wireless device connect to my wireless network"
L_NETWORKPROBLEM_FAQ_TEXT="To join the network, you can select it and enter its password, or if your computer supports WiFi Protected Setup (WPS), you can use a WPS push-button or PIN to join the network.<br><br><B>Joining a network without using WPS: </B>How you do this depends on what kind of computer you have. For example, on a Windows PC, you can open Wireless Network Connection, select the network, and enter the network password. If you are using a NETGEAR wireless adapter, you can use its Smart Wizard to connect. <br><br><B>Using WPS to join a network:</B>  Press the WPS button on the router, then within 2 minutes click the WPS button on your computer or wireless device. The computer or wireless device joins the network. <br><br>If you changed the wireless network name and network password, and you don’t remember what they are, you can log in to the router from a computer already on the network to view these settings.  The user name for the router is <b>admin</b>. Its default password is <b>password</b>.  <br><br>If you have a preset router, it came with a unique wireless network name and network password. Both of these are on the router label. <br><br>To log in to the router, go to <a href = 'http://routerlogin.net'>http://routerlogin.net</a> log in select Wireless Settings, and get the wireless network name (SSID) and security information.<br><br></B>"
L_NETWORKPROBLEM_FAQ_LABEL_1="What to do first when there is no connection to the router or the Internet"
L_NETWORKPROBLEM_FAQ_TEXT_1="Try this power cycling sequence first to solve a network connection issue:<br><br>1.Turn off and unplug the power of the modem<br>2.Turn off the router<br>   3.Plug in the power of the modem and turn it on. Wait for 2 minutes<br>4.Turn on the router and wait for 1 minute"
L_NETWORKPROBLEM_FAQ_LABEL_2="I can connect to the router, but not to the Internet"
L_NETWORKPROBLEM_FAQ_TEXT_2="If you can connect to the router but not to the Internet, log in to the router and make sure the Internet Service Provider (ISP) settings are correct. These settings are located in the Basic Settings page on <a href = 'http://routerlogin.net'>http://routerlogin.net</a>. The correct settings depend on your broadband service. Typically for DSL, you enter the DSL username (like xxx@att.net) and the DSL password.<br><br>If you are unsure which settings to use, contact your ISP.<br><br>If you have Internet through cable service, make sure your cable modem is powered off and then on during router set-up. If the router still does not get an Internet connection from the modem, it could be because the modem remembers the previous device's MAC address (for instance, the MAC address from the computer that you used to access the Internet before you got a router). You can enter that device's MAC in the Basic Settings page on <a href = 'http://routerlogin.net'>http://routerlogin.net</a>."
L_NETWORKPROBLEM_FAQ_LABEL_3="What is the password to log in to my router?"
L_NETWORKPROBLEM_FAQ_TEXT_3="The router user name is <B>admin</B>.<br><br>The default password is <B>password</B>.<br><br>Try the default password before restoring factory settings.<br><br>If your NETGEAR router supports <b>Password Recovery</b>, enables it when you change router password. <br><br>If you restore factory settings all your router’s set up information is lost and you will need to set it up all over again! For example,  the router will not remember  your Internet connection settings or any other custom settings that you specified<br><br>So, have your ISP information ready before restoring factory settings."
L_NETWORKPROBLEM_FAQ_LABEL_4="What kind of wireless security should I use for my network?"
L_NETWORKPROBLEM_FAQ_TEXT_4="To secure your wireless network, NETGEAR recommends WPA2 or WPA wireless security (WEP is an old standard and is not recommended). Wireless security helps protect your network from hackers and unauthorized users.<br><br>If you have a preset router, it has a unique wireless network name and is also set up with WPA/WPA2 wireless security and a unique password.  Others who buy the same model of router will have different wireless network names and different passwords for their networks. <br><br>For NETGEAR routers, you can set up WPA2 or WPA with the NETGEAR Genie or Smart Wizard, or you can log into your router at <a href = 'http://routerlogin.net'>http://routerlogin.net</a> and go to Wireless Settings page. After you set up wireless security on the router, anyone who tries to connect wirelessly must enter the network passphrase or key that you set up. Otherwise they will not be able to connect."
L_NETWORKPROBLEM_FAQ_LABEL_5="Troubleshooting Wireless Networks"
L_NETWORKPROBLEM_FAQ_TEXT_5="Each wireless device on the wireless network must have the same settings:<br><br><B>SSID</B>: The wireless network name is case-sensitive. (Netgear is different from NETGEAR). If you have a preset router, it has a unique wireless network name, which is on its label. The default SSID for other NETGEAR wireless routers is NETGEAR.<br><br><B>Channel</B>: The wireless channels are 1 to 11 in North America (1 to 13 in other countries).<br><br><B>Mode</B>: The wireless mode should be set to infrastructure mode for clients (computers) to connect to a wireless router.<br><br><B>Encryption</B>: You have these options for encryption:<br><B>.</B>No security<br><B>.</B>Use WEP<br><B>.</B>Use WPA-PSK<br><B>.</B>Use WPA2-PSK<br><br><B>Wireless radio</B>: This should be ON (the router's wireless LED should be lit.)<br><br><B>Access Control List (ACL)</B>: If you enable an ACL on your router, make sure the MAC address of each wireless adapter is included in that list."
L_NETWORKPROBLEM_FAQ_LABEL_6="One PC is not connected to the Internet, but other PCs are"
L_NETWORKPROBLEM_FAQ_TEXT_6="Make sure this PC is set to Obtain an IP address automatically and Obtain DNS server address automatically for its IP address.
